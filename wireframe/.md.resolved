# Transaction History Wireframe
I have completed the wireframes for the new Stellar-Save transaction history and activity log interface. 

## Implementation Details
The interface was designed with modern web aesthetic principles, focusing on high-quality visuals alongside functional components:
- **Glassmorphism Theme**: Utilized `backdrop-filter: blur` with semi-transparent background cards.
- **Dark Mode Palette**: Deep slate backgrounds with vibrant accents (`#3b82f6` blue and `#8b5cf6` violet) and animated radial gradients.
- **Dynamic Interactions**: Created responsive sidebars, hover animations on table rows, and button scale effects.
- **Functional Components**:
  - **Transaction List**: Clean table view with animated load-in, status pills, and clear typography.
  - **Filters/Search**: Search bar and dropdown filters explicitly styled for the dark theme.
  - **Details Modal**: A smooth slide-in/fade-in modal overlay for providing detailed data on a specific transaction.
  - **Export UI**: A mocked export button that triggers a toast notification to demonstrate the intended user experience.

## Proof of Work
Here is a demonstration recording showing the interactive UI, hovering, searching, opening modals, and simulating an export action.
